the program creates principals and teh admin delegates read permission to 'prioncipal 'charlie'

then the program tries to have charlie delegate read to principal 'bob'

this sould be DENIED, since bob does not have delegation on the variable, but for this server, it succeeds: SET_DELEGATION, RETURNING
